Here the three folders are named trip_2019_whole_year, trip_2019_whole_year and trip_2019_whole_year. 

The data from TfL should have been placed in these folders, 
but the amount of data was too large to successfully upload to GitHub, so the folder is empty.

Readers can download the trip data for the corresponding year here: https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/

But don't worry, this won't affect the code in other folders, 
because the new tables generated in this step have already been copied to the folders that need them.
